Pandas Challenge Data Analysis Report

Overall the merged data shows a summary of 15 schools, both Charter and District high schools, with information regarding the number of students, individual test scores and funding. Different analyses were performed on this data set to understand the impact that variables such as number of students, school type and funding has on the overall test scores for the students in the individual schools. 

The data initially shows [60] that overall, schools that have a lower budget per student appear to have slightly higher average scores for both Math and Reading, as well as a higher percentage of students passing. A gradual but subtle decrease in average scores is observed as a result of higher spending, with a more pronounced decrease of actual students passing. This data seems to provide initial insights, however, further analysis of whether the size or type of schools need to be taken into account. Also, overall students appear to be succeeding at reading more than math.

Further analysis of the data [64] shows additional patterns of students scores based on the size of schools. Although no significant change is truly observed between small and medium schools, a subtle decrease in the average scores is observed for large schools. A further and more significant decrease of passing rates is observed as well for large schools, compared to small and medium schools. Further variability analysis can be done to understand these discrepancies. 

Type of school was also further investigated to understand the impact it has on the scores of students [66], and the data shows that students in Charter schools have an overall higher average score for both reading and math, and significantly higher passing rates than District schools. Further analysis to understand the overlap of the three main variables (school size, spending and type) can provide a more accurate analysis. Understanding which types of schools appear to have higher funding or school size can provide significant impact.
